To view the status of the Kubernetes deployment:

kubectl describe deployment hello-k8s
For the status of the service, run the following command:

kubectl describe service hello-k8s
Once the service is built and delivered, we can run the following command to get the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) endpoint and open it in a browser. If the message is not updated immediately, give Kubernetes some time to deploy the change.

kubectl get services hello-k8s -o wide
This service was configured with a LoadBalancer so, an AWS Elastic Load Balancer is launched by EKS for the service. The EXTERNAL-IP column contains a value that ends with elb.amazonaws.com - the full value is the DNS address
